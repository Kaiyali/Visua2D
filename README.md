# GeoMath-2D/3D

This application developed using the JAVA programming language is the first-ever collaboration between DANIEL KAIYALI  and ARCHISMAN NATH with the intention of developing a 
mathematical application that shows the audience step-by-step how to solve their math problems. This application also has numerous geometric formulas and includes visual exhibits 
of how 2D or 3D shapes look. Included in the application - users can interact with 2d or 3d shapes while exploring the numerous different functionalitiy options. Overall, this application aims to provide a visual representation of shapes and mathematical functions so that it can be useful for students and for academic purposes. By no means should this repository or programs be redistributed, or published in any way without the authors(s) - Archisman Nath or Daniel Kaiyali consent or without proper permission/license.

Please be reminded - that there is a lib folder where external libraries are placed for use. 

EXMath2D - is a 2d geometry library created by Archisman Nath and Daniel Kayali
EXMath3D - is 3d geometry library created by Archisman Nath and Daniel Kayali
OpenGL was used for this project.

This project was possible through the help of my teachers, parents, and constant support from my friend Daniel.
