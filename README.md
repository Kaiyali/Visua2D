# Visua-2D

This application developed in the java programming language is the first-ever collaboration between Daniel Kaiyali and Archisman Nath with the intention of establishing a graphical, mathematical Engine that enables the audience to solve their math problems especially in the field of 2D geometry. This application also contains several geometric formulas as well as graphic representations of how 2D shapes appear. Users can interact with 2D shapes within the application while exploring the numerous different functionality options. The software also includes a real-time view of the area, length, width, height, and other features of geometric shapes, which replies in an immediate response based on the user's interactions with the shape. Overall, this application aims to provide a visual presentation of shapes and mathematical functions to be useful for students and academic purposes.
